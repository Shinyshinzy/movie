    <hr>
    <h3>Suzume</h3>
    <h7>'Suzume' summaries the importance of childhood, the imagination of a child and the effects of promblems. The animation is wonderfull, water-colour like and is simple at the same time complicated. </h7>
    <h3>Rush Hour</h3>
    <h7>'Rush Hour' is an amazing comedy-action film starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. It is funny and also fun to watch as an action movie, it is especially good if you are a fan of Jackie Chan and his films.</h7>
    <h3>All dogs to heaven</h3>
    <h7>'All dogs go to heaven' is an emotianal film regarding of a dog who diedand came back to earth and befriending a child who is an orphan. The plot is tragic and emotional, the story of one of the main characters voice actor, a ten year old child actor, Judith Eva Barsi dying during fiml production by her father, forntunately she had recorded the entire lines and the last line meaning a complete different meaning due to the context. It is a great classic and a outstanding movie made for coping of animals</h7>
